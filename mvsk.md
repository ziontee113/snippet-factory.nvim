# MVSK

* I look at the "code" and don't know what to do.
    * Maybe I shouldn't be looking at the code.
        * --> What should I be looking at then?
        * --> Somekind of project synopsis..
            - That shows us the current progress of the project.
            * Kanban?
            * Github Projects? (Just a Kanban anyway)
            * gh.nvim

* So.. You know the synopsis about what to do..
    * But you still need to go into implementation details.
    * It's about KNOWING WHAT TO DO, and the sequence of doing it,
    not about doing it quick (because it's already is quick, and can be much faster too)
        * How do you know what to do (low-level implementation details) INSTANTLY?
            * --> A portal to another dimension, where the issue is standable & isolated.
                * --> What does this mean for Neovim development and how is it differ from let's say a Rust project?
            * -> I mean... you still have to work with the isolated problem...
                * -> It still takes work... And I don't want to work...
            * --> Well, you can write tests for it.
                * --> TDD's like playing video games right? Video games that pays.

* I have issue knowing what and where things are to pull from.
    * Adding to `vim.my_method()` is quite dirty, but effective.
